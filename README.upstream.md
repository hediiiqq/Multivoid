## Current phase

The project follows an 8-phase long-term arc (the MTA / gmod trajectory — see
[Roadmap](#roadmap) below). We are in **Phase 1: functional co-op** — the deep-sync
phase where VOTV's single-player systems are taken apart one by one and made
multiplayer-correct on the mod's own engine-extension substrate. The multiplayer
foundation (transport, sessions, master server, join/save pipeline) is built and
live; the remaining Phase-1 work is hands-on verification breadth and the tail of
game systems still to sync.

### How far along is that

The honest, granular answer — **what we sync and what we don't, system by
system** — is the main coverage document:
**[`docs/COOP_SYNC_PROFILES.md`](docs/COOP_SYNC_PROFILES.md)**. It opens with a
master table of ~67 co-op systems (~215 facets), each carrying a verdict
(works / broken / unknown / not-built), an evidence tier, and who owns the
write, followed by a per-system catalog with a "what we do NOT sync" line for
each. Start there. Every wire lane in the game is accounted for in it (121
reliable message kinds + 14 pose/state streams, all cross-checked); facet-level
completeness is deliberately never claimed — the honest output is a count with a
named residual, not a checkmark.

We also deliberately don't publish a single "N% done" figure — a co-op mod is
finished system by system, not on one bar, and any summed percentage would hide
which systems are solid and which are untouched. The one honest headline count,
generated from the game's own class dump by
[`tools/coverage.py`](tools/coverage.py): of **2291** game classes, **1453** can
actually diverge between peers, and our code names **175** of them. The
measurement error on each rung, and why a finer verb-level percentage isn't yet
honest, are recorded in the project's research corpus, which is kept privately.

---

## What works today

### Multiplayer foundation
- **LAN and Internet sessions** — one host, up to three clients; direct IP or the
  built-in **server browser** backed by the official master server
  (NAT traversal via signaling + TURN)
- **Version identity + join gate** — lobbies advertise `game + build`
  (e.g. `0.9.0n b146`); mismatched peers are refused pre-flight with a clear popup
  instead of desyncing mid-game. Old cohorts keep playing together forever —
  updates are never forced
- **Visible remote players** — full body, legs, IK feet, per-player skins,
  animated locomotion, ragdoll mirroring
- **Floating nameplates** with nickname + live ping, **chat**, and a system event
  feed (joins, leaves, activity lines)
- **Voice chat** — 3D positional, in-world
- **Join at any time** — connecting clients receive the host's full world state
  (a save-transfer snapshot), and **mid-activity join is a supported case by
  design**: joining mid-event, mid-download, mid-drive, mid-anything is handled
  per-system, never "don't join during X"

### Synced world
- **Physics props** — pickup, drag, drop, throw across the ~540 `Aprop_C` classes,
  including client-born props, per-grab authority transfer, and stable cross-peer
  identity that survives saves and rejoins
- **Piles and trash collection** — the full pickup/carry/deposit economy loop
- **NPCs and creatures** — host-simulated, pose-streamed to clients; kerfurs
  including the prop⇄NPC conversion cycle and per-kerfur skins
- **World events** — the scheduled/story event system replays host-observed events
  on clients with per-event dupe policies
- **Weather** — rain, snow, fog, wind, lightning; host-authoritative (clients
  never roll their own RNG — shared-world randomness is host-owned as a rule)
- **Doors, lights, switches, keypads, terminals**, sleep, damage/hazards,
  world-prop progression (drying, curing, growing — host owns the clock)

### The signal-processing pipeline (the heart of VOTV)
End-to-end sync of the workstation: dish control and calibration → ping →
signal catch → downloads → decoding → playback deck → drives and racks →
the in-game laptop (shared editable buffer, floppies, discs) → the meadow
signal database. Presser-authored state, one authority per axis, with the
desk's audio feedback mirrored to observers at the native audio seam.

### Infrastructure
- **UE4SS-ecosystem mod folder** — ships as `Mods\Multivoid\dlls\main.dll`,
  loaded by UE4SS (manual installs) or unreal-shimloader (r2modman /
  Thunderstore), with **zero imports from UE4SS** — the whole substrate
  (reflection, hooks, transport, UI) is the mod's own
- **Official master server** — a static Rust binary on our VPS (lobby list,
  update check, signaling); the update check is informational only, never a gate
- **Menu kill switch** in the ini (`multiplayer_menu_off`) — hides the
  Multiplayer button so a build ships without an entry point. It removes the
  door, not the mod: the DLL stays loaded and its hooks stay installed

---

## How it works

VOTV runs on Unreal Engine 4.27. The mod is one DLL living in a standard
UE4SS mod folder:

```
Mods\Multivoid\dlls\main.dll   -- the whole mod (UE4SS starts it via the C-ABI start_mod() contract)
Mods\Multivoid\enabled.txt
```

UE4SS (or r2modman's unreal-shimloader) is the *loader* only: the DLL imports
nothing from it. The mod resolves engine primitives (`GUObjectArray` /
`GNames` / `ProcessEvent`) via its own AOB signatures, then drives VOTV's own
`UClass` / `UFunction` machinery through reflection — no asset edits,
no `.pak` repacks. Where ProcessEvent can't see (Blueprint-internal dispatch),
a bytecode-level VM interception substrate catches the invisible verbs.

Transport is **GameNetworkingSockets** (Valve's UDP library) carrying an
unreliable pose stream plus a reliable ordered channel for events and state.
Each machine's local UE engine re-derives animation, physics, and rendering
from the streamed state. The host is authoritative for world state, RNG, and
NPC simulation; per-grab authority transfers for held props.

The codebase splits along a strict two-layer principle:
- [`src/votv-coop/src/ue_wrap/`](src/votv-coop/src/ue_wrap/) — engine wrapper (reflection, offsets, hooks; no gameplay)
- [`src/votv-coop/src/coop/`](src/votv-coop/src/coop/) — gameplay/network layer (element identity, sync lanes, sessions)
- [`src/votv-coop/src/harness/`](src/votv-coop/src/harness/) — boot glue + autonomous test scenarios

---

## Versioning

The version identity is the pair **(game version, build number)** — there is
no separate mod semver.

```
Multivoid 0.9.0n b<N>   ->   the in-game banner, main.dll's own VERSIONINFO
                             and the release tag (v0.9.0n-b<N>[-dev])
                             carry the pair verbatim
```

- **Game target** (`0.9.0n`) bumps when we adapt to a new VOTV cook
  (reflection offsets and BP layouts shift between game versions).
- **Build number** (`b<N>`) is the wire-protocol revision — it bumps with every
  release and every wire-format change.
- **The zip's `x.y.z` is the same pair, encoded — not a third version axis.**
  Mod managers require a strictly numeric `major.minor.patch`, so the zip is
  named `Pelmentor-Multivoid-<game major>.<game minor>.<N>.zip` — for the
  `0.9.0n` target that is `Pelmentor-Multivoid-0.9.<N>.zip`. The game target's
  third field and letter don't fit that grammar and are deliberately dropped;
  the build number alone already identifies a release exactly.
- **Join compatibility is byte-equality on the pair, per lobby.** When VOTV
  0.10.0 ships we adapt immediately, but 0.9.0n cohorts keep playing among
  themselves on their old builds — updates are never forced. The server browser
  shows each lobby's pair and marks mismatches before you click.

Source of truth: [`src/votv-coop/CMakeLists.txt`](src/votv-coop/CMakeLists.txt)
(`VOTVCOOP_GAME_TARGET` + the build number parsed from `protocol.h`).

## Quick start

### For players

> **There is no stable release yet — every build on the
> [Releases page](https://github.com/VOTV-MP/Multivoid/releases) is a dev build,
> and everyone playing one is a tester.** Expect bugs, and please report them on
> [Discord](https://discord.gg/bA6tGBvGMN) — good reports get credited in
> [Credits](#credits). Full
> disclaimer and what to attach: **[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**.

One zip, two ways to install it: through **r2modman** (recommended — it sets up
the loader itself) or manually into the game's UE4SS `Mods\` folder. Launch —
a **Multiplayer** button appears in the main menu. No port forwarding needed.
Full steps, updating, and troubleshooting: **[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**.

To uninstall, remove the mod in the manager (or delete the `Mods\Multivoid`
folder). The mod never touches the game's own files.

### For developers

Full guide: [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) — local toolchain setup, troubleshooting,
and **building via GitHub Actions** (no local toolchain needed: fork, dispatch
the `build` workflow, download the DLL artifact).

Requirements: Windows 10+, Visual Studio 2019/2022 **Build Tools** (C++ workload),
CMake 3.20+, and a legitimate copy of Voices of the Void at `Game_0.9.0n_HOST/`
next to the repo.

```powershell
# Configure once:
cmake -B build/votv-coop -S src/votv-coop -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64

# Build:
cmake --build build/votv-coop --config Release
```

Dev-only launchers (deploy the fresh build + start the game with a pinned
role/port — never how players run the mod):

```powershell
./mp_host_game.bat                 # host, default port 47621
./mp_client_connect.bat <host-ip>  # client
```

Same-PC testing? Use the sibling `Game_0.9.0n_CLIENT_1/` install — the launchers
detect it automatically. The autonomous two-peer test harness lives in `tools/`.

## Roadmap

The long-term arc, in order (each phase gates the next — detail in
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md)):

| # | Phase | Status |
|--|--|--|
| 1 | **Functional co-op** — deep sync of VOTV's systems on the mod's own substrate | **in progress (current)** |
| 2 | **The arbiter** — per-element authority moves into a separate, engine-free server process; the host's game becomes an ordinary client of it | planned |
| 3 | **Sandbox mode** — support VOTV's sandbox rules as an explicit, portable "mode" layer | planned |
| 4 | **LuaJIT embedding** — the scripting substrate over the engine/coop APIs | planned |
| 5 | **Lua API** — mode rules move to Lua; the C++ core (transport, sync, identity) stays native | planned |
| 6 | **Resource system** — custom modes and plugins as one mechanism (the MTA shape) | planned |
| 7 | **Dedicated server** — 24/7 hosting with no live player required; the same server binary phase 2 already ships, launched by hand instead of spawned by the game | planned |
| 8 | **Resource infrastructure** — client-side resource download, sandboxing, public server browser | planned |

The old phase 8 ("native standalone server") was **retired as a phase** on 2026-07-20: the server is a
separate process from phase 2 onward, and its authority grows with every sync lane, so the MTA endgame
arrives by accumulation rather than as a milestone. See
[`docs/COOP_SERVER_MODEL.md`](docs/COOP_SERVER_MODEL.md).

---

## Architecture

Built on **eight architectural principles** documented in
[`docs/COOP_METHODOLOGY.md`](docs/COOP_METHODOLOGY.md):

1. **No modification of original game files**
2. **Engine-extension paradigm** — the mod is a new engine layer, not a patch
3. **Parallel class hierarchy** — our `RemotePlayer` owns network state; UE owns rendering
4. **Targeted crash fixes, not broad suppression**
5. **Minimum viable subset** — scope is a living document
6. **Augment SP, never replace it** — co-op is layered ON single-player
7. **Engine-wrapper layer vs gameplay/network layer** — strict subtree split
8. **Mid-activity join is always handled** — every sync lane defines its late-join answer

Three "no-compromise" rules govern day-to-day work:
- **RULE 1** — No crutches, no quick fixes. Root cause every time.
- **RULE 2** — No migration baggage. Old code goes when replaced.
- **RULE 3** — Own substrate. The mod ships as a normal UE4SS mod folder
  (decision 2026-08-21; the standalone xinput-proxy loader retired whole), but
  UE4SS is the *loader*, never the engine layer: the DLL imports nothing from
  it, and all reflection/hooking/transport stays the mod's own. The dated
  decision ledger is in
  [docs/VERSION_MIGRATION.md §11](docs/VERSION_MIGRATION.md).

## Credits

Multivoid is written and directed by one person (Pelmentor) with heavy use of
AI coding tools — direction, architecture, testing and every release decision
are mine; much of the code was written with Claude. The full commit history is
public, so you can judge the process as well as the result.

**Everything else in it came from outside, in one of three forms — code,
reports, and review.** The rule is the same for all three: if it changed the mod,
it gets a row.

| Who | Kind | Contribution | Landed |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Pelmentor** | code | Architecture, direction, releases — the whole mod | 474 commits |
| **Claude** (Anthropic) | code | Implementation, across the whole mod | 1,368 commits |
| **Tarangok** | code | KO respawn, live skin preview, held-prop visibility, container extraction | 10 commits |

Prior art this project learned from, with thanks:

| Project | What it gave Multivoid |
|--|--|
| [MTA:SA](https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue) (GPLv3, vendored read-only) | The architectural precedent: the parallel class hierarchy, per-element syncers, keysync shape, host-authoritative AI. Multivoid follows MTA's shapes deliberately — no MTA code is copied. |
| [RE-UE4SS](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS) (MIT) | The UE4 modding substrate this project stands on: its reflection algorithms are ported (with attribution in the source), it is the everyday development tool (SDK header dumps, Blueprint dumps, live inspection) — and since the mod-folder migration it is also the *loader* the shipping mod runs under. The mod still imports nothing from it (the D-3 slim contract): UE4SS starts `main.dll` and everything after that is Multivoid's own code. |
| [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) (MIT) | The x64 trampoline hooking engine (vendored). |
| **VoidTogether** | The first multiplayer attempt for VOTV, and useful to read while designing this one. No VoidTogether code is in Multivoid (it is a JS server; this is a C++ in-process mod), but two things came from studying it and are cited in the source where they are used: the nickname-sanitizer approach ([`player_handshake.cpp`](src/votv-coop/src/coop/session/player_handshake.cpp)) and widget-styling comparisons that shaped the nameplate look ([`engine_widget.cpp`](src/votv-coop/src/ue_wrap/engine/engine_widget.cpp)). |
| [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) (MIT), [GameNetworkingSockets](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets) (BSD), [Opus](https://opus-codec.org/) (BSD), [FreeType](https://freetype.org/) (FTL), [miniaudio](https://miniaud.io/) (MIT/public domain) | Vendored libraries — UI, transport, voice, text rendering, audio. |

## Legal

This is a **hook-only mod**: the mod's code contains **no Voices of the Void
code or assets**. You must own a legitimate copy of the game to use it.

The repository is licensed under the **MIT License** (see `LICENSE`) — the
same family as the projects it builds on (MinHook, Dear ImGui, and the
UE4SS-derived reflection algorithms, all MIT; GameNetworkingSockets and Opus,
BSD). The optional starter-skin pak bundled with releases (`scientists.pak`)
is a community conversion of third-party game assets and is **not** covered
by the MIT license. Unaffiliated with the VOTV authors.

### A note from the author

This project is a free labour of love. I discovered VOTV in 2023 and played it
for weeks relentlessly, and I've been coming back every year since to explore
its new features. Every one of those runs was a great solo experience — and
eventually I wanted to share it with someone in multiplayer.

Let me be upfront: I'm not a programmer. Or rather, I am one — just with far
less baggage than a project of this magnitude demands. My roles here are
coordinator, director, tester, and architect.

I've always been into modding. My first mods were for GTA:SA when I was 10 or
11 — simple things like new objects on the map. Later I ran a SA-MP server with
my own gamemode, and a few Minecraft servers, and along the way I picked up how
it all actually works underneath. At some point I got into assembly-level mods
with Cheat Engine and learned a few things there — what opcodes are, how memory
scanning works, and so on — and made basic mods for some old games that way.

I never went especially deep, but that experience turned out to be useful
enough when I decided to build this project with Fable-5.

Going in, I already knew about projects like SA-MP and MTA, so I had somewhere
to pull principles and methodology from — and I did. Today's AI tools are
genuinely something, and combining them with IDA 9 over MCP, a proper
methodology, and agents analyzing Kismet bytecode gave me the dev environment
and the virtual team I needed.

To anyone hating on AI or AI-produced code: if you used AI for programming and
got garbage results, it means either your process is the problem or your tool
is a cheap one. Get a better tool, try a better methodology, and always
document your progress. Not just progress — document everything, every session.
And document it properly.
