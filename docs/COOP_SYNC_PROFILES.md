# Per-system sync profiles — what we sync, what we don't, facet by facet

**What this is.** For one game SYSTEM, the list of its sync FACETS with a status each. It answers the
question the class register cannot: *inside this thing, what works and what doesn't.*

**What this is NOT.** Not a percentage, and not derivable. Read §3 before adding a system — the
limits are structural, and a profile read as a measurement is worse than no profile.


## 1. Master summary table — every synced system, one row

Derived from the full facet catalog in §2 (2026-07-23 sweep: 8 read-only fact-gatherers over the whole
`coop/` tree, verdicts authored here). **This is a COUNT view, never a percentage** — the facet
denominator is unenumerable (§3). Read a row as "this system has N facets in these states", not "N% done".

**Legend.** Verdict `W`=WORKS · `B`=BROKEN · `U`=UNKNOWN (lane exists, behaviour unobserved) · `NB`=NOT
BUILT. Evidence `HO`=hands-on · `log` · `ST`=selftest/e2e · `code` · `inf` · `–`. Authority `HA`=host-authored ·
`CA`=client-authored · `ARB`=arbiter · `CO`=co-authored · `PO`=peer-owned (own disjoint slice, streamed) · `PP`=peer-private (never shared) · `∅`=none/convergent-local. `recv-local` in a catalog cite = a receiver-side derivation of a `PO` stream (authority `∅`, inherits its input row).

> **The evidence bar in this catalog is DELIBERATELY LOOSER than the README's `verified_takes.tsv` "2".**
> `HO` here means "observed working in hands-on play" — for the visible foundation (remote bodies, chat,
> voice, join) that is everyday-observed, and for a mechanic it is a dated runbook where one exists. The
> README's "2 verified" counts ONLY formally-logged takes and is the stricter, auditable number. When a
> take-4 (2026-07-21) hands-on showed a BUG and a fix shipped after but was NOT re-played, the verdict
> stays at the last MEASURED state (`B/HO`) with the fix noted — the same "last measured" rule as
> container #6. Most mechanic-specific facets have no observation at all and sit at `U/code` — that
> majority IS the honest state, and it is what a class-level percentage hides.

**What the table shows at a glance (counts, not a score):**
- **~67 systems, ~215 facets.** The single largest evidence bucket is `code` (a lane exists, never
  observed) — the honest majority §3 predicts a class-percentage would hide.
- **The verified core is the VISIBLE loop:** remote bodies, chat, voice, join/save-transfer, the
  grab-carry-throw prop economy, keypads, kerfur/NPC, wisp/pyramid — each carries `HO`. The workstation
  SIGNAL pipeline is the opposite: mostly `U/code` or `B/HO` (take-4 caught real bugs; fixes shipped
  unverified).
- **True arbiters are RARE and enumerable:** device-occupancy, drive-rack, phys-mods, floppybox,
  laptop-buffer-quad, shop-order, sleep-tally, container-CAS. Everywhere else authority is host-authored
  one-way or co-authored + host-relay — NOT the syncer-model arbiter (`docs/COOP_SYNCER_MODEL.md` is
  DESIGN, unbuilt). This table is the concrete input to "which facets a dedicated-server migration touches".
- **The sweep grew the AUTHORITY axis by ONE value — `peer-owned` — and added NO new axis.** Body pose,
  own skin, hand pose, voice frames, the eyer, fireflies: each peer authors its OWN disjoint slice and
  streams it, no contention and no arbiter. That is neither `peer-private` (§3 defines it "never shared",
  and these ARE shared) nor `co-authored` (no shared contested state — the slices are disjoint). It is the
  player/creature-mirror pattern the four §4–4 controls never hit, and it is a whole authority class the
  class register cannot see. `peer-private` proper stays for the genuinely-unshared: player-inventory,
  the garbage crash-fix, coord_isPing, the local sim-teardowns.
- **Some coop systems carry NO wire at all** — moderation (kick/ban via GNS-close + host-local files),
  save-suppression (client-local save lockout), spawn-authority (client spawner park). They enforce host
  authority "by construction", not by a packet. A wire-lane census is structurally blind to them; only a
  system-by-system read finds them (§9). This is the §3 spine claim — system, not lane — proving out, and
  it is exactly what the FIRST sweep missed until the self-audit.

## 2. The full facet catalog

One compact table per system (the master table's source). Citations are (file, SYMBOL); `NOT SYNCED`
lines carry the user's "что НЕ синхроним" half. Verdict discipline per §3: `code`-only ⇒ `U` (unobserved),
a take-4 bug that a later unverified fix addressed stays at its last-measured `B`.

### World / interactables — small systems (`coop/world/`, `coop/interactables/`, `coop/items/order_sync`)

| Time-of-day | clock steady-state | U | code | HA | `time_sync::ApplyClockSnapshot` | seed (connect-edge) |
| Time-of-day | clock connect-edge | U | code | HA | `time_sync::OnReliable` | THIS is the seed |
| Time-of-day | sleep-accelerate toggle | U | code | CO | `SetSleepAccelerate` | none (sleep lane) |
| Alarm | klaxon `active` on/off | U | code | CO | `alarm_sync::Apply` | snapshot incl active=0 |
| Balance | canonical Points total | U | code | HA | `balance_sync::ApplyFromHost` | connect-replay |
| Balance | credit delta request | **RETIRED v135** | code | n/a | The facet no longer exists: `OnDeltaRequest` and the whole client->host `BalanceDelta` lane were deleted 2026-08-24 (security A5). A connected client cannot author the shared balance at all; `CreditLocal` refuses and logs. The host's Points poll broadcasts the new total | n/a |
| Balance | a CLIENT's earning — COIN PICKUP | **SHIPPED, field-verified** | live log | HA | **The one credit lane that works.** `CoinCollect=124` (v139): the client observes both entries (the overlap BndEvt, and the `0x45` `actionOptionIndex` E-press) and forwards the coin's EID; the host resolves it against its own WorldActor registry and dispatches the COIN's own verb, so the game's native credit runs on the AUTHORITY and the balance broadcast follows. `[V]` 2026-08-25 field log: **19 forwards -> 19 `coingun[host collect]: PERFORMED`, 1:1, balance 324 -> 634**, denominations +5/+25/+50 | host-minted actor, no save key |
| Balance | a CLIENT's earning — EVERYTHING ELSE | **BROKEN** | code | none | **No path exists** for drone sale, task reward, or any other local credit. `balance_sync.cpp:48-58` is host-poll + broadcast-on-change; the client branch only writes the host's absolute value, so a locally-earned credit is stomped by the next host-side change and the earning is LOST. Security **A13**; the root is `lib_C::addPoints`, whose 19 call sites are `EX_LocalVirtualFunction` and therefore PE-invisible. **CORRECTION 2026-08-25:** this row used to say "there are zero `sell`/`coin` hits in the tree" and to name coin pickup as an example of the loss — both were true when written on 2026-08-24 and are now FALSE. `coingun_collect.cpp` exists and the row above is its measured result | n/a |
| Coin | a coin mirror's BIRTH VALUE (its material) | **BUILT b143, NOT field-verified** | smoke + bytecode | HA | **The colour is the game's, not ours.** `[V]` `baocoin_C::ReceiveBeginPlay` -> `ExecuteUbergraph_baocoin(1441)` reads `points` and calls `baocoin.SetMaterial(0,..)`: <=10 bronze @1499, >11 && <=25 silver @1725, >26 gold @1820. `[V]` `sell` writes that int BETWEEN BeginDeferred and FinishSpawning; our mirror had NOTHING in that window, so every mirrored coin was born at the CDO default **5** and painted bronze -- and 5 is also the commonest real value (13 of the field's 19), so ~32% disagreed and the rest agreed by accident. `WorldActorSpawnPayload.birth[64]` now carries it, as an OPAQUE blob the receiving class decodes (proto 143, `dcf73c26`). **PROVEN: the payload round-trips (`piramid2_C` at `scale=(2.00,..)`). NOT PROVEN: the VALUE path -- both smokes contained zero coins.** Design section 14 | birth-time only; `points` is read-only after birth, so the join re-snapshot is correct by construction |
| Daily-task | taskNew (arrays + scalars) | U | code | HA | `OnTaskNewState` | baseline-first-sight (save transfer) |
| Email | row append (chunked) | U | code | HA | `email_sync::CompleteAssembly` | save transfer + shadow prime |

FIELD 2026-08-29 (see TRACKER FIELD-2026-08-29): does not cross in either direction, and the host log shows why -- `index rebuilt -- 1 live keyed instance(s)` at boot, 15 probes over 28 s on the same actor pointer, then `index rebuilt -- 0 live keyed instance(s) keysHash=0x0` and it NEVER recovers: the join snapshot reports `sent 0 full state(s) (of 0 indexed)` and a client open lands as `'garage_2' not present yet -- deferring ON` then `deferred 'garage_2' expired`. The 25 s TTL is only the executioner; the cause is that the actor stops being FOUND. Sibling channels in the same session never lose theirs (appliance 52976 probes, container 47890, door 42676, light 35844, doorbox 17120 -- garage 15), so this is garage-specific, not an engine-wide scan defect. Suspected shape: full passes stop once every consumer settles, a later backstop full pass clears `byKey_` and repopulates from an empty `scanFound_`, and an empty index then counts as settled -- so zero latches. NOT ROOT-CAUSED: the exact drop point on the full-pass path is unidentified, and an attempted fix that moved identity back onto `AtriggerBase_C::Key` was REJECTED in review -- the design banner says that save Key is unreliable for garages (which is why v123 moved to the level-export FName in the first place), and swapping identity silently changes what the bytes mean between peers on the same protocol number]** | snapshot (level-export FName) |

| ATV | rig pose + velocity (occupant OR host-idle) | U | code | CA/HA | `coop::atv_corrector::ApplyCorrection` (NOT `atv_sync` -- extracted 2026-08-30 `f802104e`; `SetTarget`/`LerpWindow` RETIRED 2026-08-29, the mirror simulates and is corrected, it is not interpolated). **Since `18edd22a` the LINEAR velocity is not written at all when the AUTHOR is linearly at rest**; angular is written regardless, through `engine::SetActorRootPhysicsAngularVelocity`. **REASON CORRECTED 2026-08-30 (ATV.md §17, which supersedes §16): that rule did NOT cause the 25-40 cm sink and is not what fixed it.** A four-run single-variable pass acquitted this corrector outright -- with the collision guard disabled it produces the best settled gap measured (A2 3.0 cm). The sink was `atv_hit_guard` cancelling the five WHEEL ComponentHit delegates on a non-owner, which cost the mirror its rig SHAPE. The at-rest rule stands on its own merits (MTA's `bSyncVelocity` shape) and is not a cure. **CANCELLING IS GONE ENTIRELY since `28a958e8`** -- the guard now NEUTERS (zeroes `NormalImpulse` in the params frame, dispatches the handler whole), so neither the rig shape nor the damage suppression depends on dropping a notification; `[V]` mirror wear 100/100/100/100 after, 98.22/100/100/98.48 before. **A separate facet is still UNSYNCED and now measured: tire wear itself** -- the author's real `tiresDurability` reaches no other peer, so the peers legitimately disagree (100.00 vs 96.24 in the acceptance run). `docs/vehicles/ATV.md` §17.12/17.16 | snapshot adopt=1 (pose+velocity) |
| ATV | authority-release (NOT a throw) | U | code | CA | `OnAtvRelease` -- clears `authorSlot` and nothing else since 2026-08-29; the six velocity floats that launched the other peer's copy are DELETED | none |
| ATV | ~~purchased~~ **mid-session** spawn | U | code | HA | `OnAtvSpawn`. **LABEL CORRECTED 2026-08-29:** no row in the 473-row `list_store` and no craft recipe sells an ATV `[V]`, so the lane's own comment (`atv_sync.cpp:123`, "a bought ATV is delivered ONLY on the host") is FALSE. The code's real predicate is `isHost && key not-in g_savePlacedKeys && obj not-in g_savePlacedActors` (`:326-327`) = "an ATV first seen after the baseline window". **Whether ANY such ATV exists is now MEASURED [V] 2026-08-29: YES, and the RULE-2 deletion is CANCELLED** — `list_props` row `atv` has `spawnAsObject = ATV_C`, `hidden = false`, spawned via `lib.PropToObject` -> `spawnPropThroughGamemode` from `ui_spawnmenu` (whole-pak census, `docs/vehicles/ATV.md` §11.4). The lane STAYS; only its comment is wrong | snapshot (synth key) |
| ATV | ~~purchased~~ **mid-session** destroy | U | code | HA | `OnAtvDestroy`; same corrected premise as the row above | n/a |
| ATV | seat contention (mount deny) | U | code | CA | PR #9 `ca89cc1e` + `c4aabe15`: `occupantSlot` per indexed ATV; the deny is a client-side PRODUCER suppression at `device_occupancy::OnUseInputPre` (`ClearAimForDispatch`), and a simultaneous mount is settled by LOWER SLOT WINS in `atv_sync::OnReliable`. Build + smoke only -- the smoke does NOT put two peers on one ATV, so the tie-break has never been observed firing | snapshot (adopt=1 carries `e.occupantSlot`, so a joiner inherits the active driver) |
| Shop-order | new order forward | HO | code+drill | ARB | v136 `afcbff39`: the intent is a `list_store` ROW NAME only; the host PRICES it from its own table, checks its own balance, rolls its own ETA, confirms an `OrderCount()` +1 edge, then charges (`order_sync::ResolveOne`). GREEN+RED drill on DLL `899E80EDE468AEC1`; NOT hands-on | watermark-prime |
| Appliance | on/off bool (6 classes) | U | code | CO | `g_applianceAdapter` | snapshot |
| Container (device) | open/closed state | U | code | CO | `interactable_sync` `g_container` (`ReliableKind::ContainerState`) | snapshot |

NOT SYNCED (world/misc): client clock never free-runs (TimeScale forced 0); balance HUD repaint is client-local; daily-task leans on save-transfer for JOIN state (no connect snapshot; email gained the ready-edge SEED 2026-08-23 `0676e5a8` -- join-window rows now delivered); unkeyed doors keep native behaviour; door swing is force-snap not animated when far; serverbox break/fix verbs are invisible (state+`check()` mirror); grime/window FAR vanishes ignored (stream-out); calm turbine world goes silent; idle save-ATVs stay per-peer physics until authored -- and **per-peer TICK**, so `fuel`/`battery`/`dirt` accumulate INDEPENDENTLY on every peer (`[V]` 2026-08-29: the accumulators are `ReceiveTick`-only and nothing parks an unauthored mirror's tick) = a live `COOP_WORLD_PROP_DIVERGENCE` instance, not merely a physics-ownership note. **RUNTIME-MEASURED 2026-08-29 (`docs/vehicles/ATV.md` §13) and the shape is sharper than that sentence: at IDLE there is NO observable divergence** -- 144 aligned samples, fuel/battery/dirt identical at 100.000/100.000/0.0000 on both peers, median body separation **0.3 cm** -- because an engine that is off accumulates nothing. The divergence is real but it needs a RUNNING ATV to appear: the moment the host drove, host fuel went 100 -> 99.439 while the client's stayed at exactly 100.000, and the bodies reached **109.9 cm** apart; client never mutates its own shop orders; sub-second event cues escape the 1 Hz poll.

**R17 attempt 2026-08-29 -- ABANDONED, and what it found.** A verb-edge capture was built and then reverted; no code from it ships. The intended shape (`docs/LESSONS.md:3302-3309`: capture at the native verb edge instead of polling) is correct in principle, and the three mutating verbs -- `comp_uploadData`, `saveSignal`, `deleteSignal` -- ARE observable via the existing `vm_dispatch` `0x45` substrate, which `drive_sync` already registers. It was abandoned because the surrounding reliability semantics cannot support it as-is. Recorded so the next attempt starts here rather than rediscovering it:

1. **The substrate offers only an ENTRY edge.** At the edge the mutation has not happened, so the value cannot be read there. A deferred read plus a single dirty bit CANNOT be lossless: two mutations before the drain collapse into one capture. Curing the R17 loss class needs a POST-CALL edge, i.e. a substrate feature, not a consumer-side change.
2. **No drain site is safe from running pre-mutation.** The pump composite is drained on ANY game-thread `ProcessEvent`, including one nested inside the verb body (`src/votv-coop/src/ue_wrap/core/pe_detour.cpp:334`); `DrainPostedTasksAtTopLevel` is not a general re-entrancy barrier, it only defers during the spawn-refusal window. A premature drain is therefore always reachable, and is only harmless if the mark survives it -- i.e. the mark must be cleared on CONFIRMED PUBLICATION, never on attempt.
3. **`ProcessCompData` advances `g_lastDataKey` and reports success even when the session is disconnected or `SendData` failed.** Because the advanced baseline is what suppresses retries, an unsent change becomes permanently unsendable. A partial blob send counts as failure per `src/votv-coop/include/coop/net/blob_chunks.h:53-56` (success = every chunk accepted).
4. **The comp scalar path discards both reliable-send results and advances the falling-edge baseline unconditionally**, and the connect replay ignores `SendState`/`SendData` results. A refused send there is never retried. Pre-existing, independent of R17.
5. **A refused `SavedSignalDelete` corrupts shadow/live index alignment**: the failed row stays in the next shadow while it is gone from the live array, so a subsequent append is read from the wrong index and can be marked sent without being published.
6. **A transient `ReadRow` failure permanently consumes a legitimate append** -- the row is left or set to `sent = true` on a read failure, so it is never published.
7. **Simultaneous writers diverge permanently.** The host relay skips the origin (`if (i == originSlot) continue`, `src/votv-coop/src/coop/net/session_relay.cpp:80`): C1 writes A, C2 writes B, the host orders A then B -> host=B, C1=B, C2=A, and every reconciler sees its own key equal to its baseline, so C2 is never repaired.

Items 3-6 are silent-loss paths that exist independently of R17 and would each need fixing before an edge-capture rewrite could be trusted.

| 5 | **the name's ALPHABET (non-ASCII)** | **W** for Latin+Cyrillic+emoji, **sentinel-by-design** for CJK/Hangul/Thai | **HO** (Cyrillic photographed on board AND plate at 26 bytes; emoji photographed in colour on DX11 AND DX12 boards) | ∅ (local render) | `coop/text/utf8_codec` owns BOTH directions — decodes at entry (strict on receive) and `CopyUtf8ToBuffer` on egress into every `char nick[kNickBufBytes]`. **Arc D2 BUILT 2026-07-28 (`5947d391`)**: one emoji donor embedded (Twemoji, whole cmap, +689 KB, `IMGUI_USE_WCHAR32` + `LoadColor`), the other three families cross-merge behind the chosen one, and U+FFFD is now BAKED so an absent codepoint draws the replacement character instead of `'?'`. CJK/Hangul/Thai deliberately still render as the sentinel — the design closes facet 8 instead of widening the alphabet | n/a — a render property, not a lane |
| 6 | **the name's LENGTH through the render path** | **W** (was **BROKEN** until 2026-07-28 `f19eedac`) | **HO** | ∅ (local render) | five fixed buffers were literal `char nick[24]` against a policy stated in 20 CODEPOINTS; `WideCharToMultiByte` returns 0 rather than truncating, so the row BLANKED past 12 Cyrillic / 8 hanzi / 6 emoji. This facet exists because facet 5 read `W` while a name in the very alphabet it certified still vanished at length — an alphabet facet and a capacity facet are two questions | n/a — render |
| 7 | **plate LAYOUT (what is centred)** | **W** (`eb0bcdf5`) | **HO** (measured 0.0 px at 8x) | ∅ (local render) | the plate centres the NICK; the ping annotation hangs off its right edge and takes no part in the centring, so a ping gaining a digit moves only itself. Previously `"<nick> (<ping>)"` was centred as one string | n/a — render |
| 8 | **does the assigned uniqueness SURVIVE TO THE PIXEL** | **W** (BUILT 2026-07-28 `5947d391`; drilled cross-peer on DX11+DX12, NOT hands-on) | `code` + drill (`张伟` alone bare, `李明` beside it → `李明2`, `Anna中` sentinels only the hanzi) | **HA** (the fold is a build constant; the host assigns) | facet 4 is `W` only in the STRING domain. ImGui substitutes ONE `FallbackGlyph` for EVERY absent codepoint (`imgui_draw.cpp:3830-3838`), so two distinct CJK names have distinct fold keys, get NO suffix, and draw identically — arc B's guarantee is silently false for any script we do not bake. §9d closed it by folding out-of-repertoire codepoints to ONE sentinel (U+FFFD — the character they actually draw as) so the names collide and take the existing suffix; that makes it font-INDEPENDENT rather than budget-shaped. AS-BUILT + the three design claims measurement falsified: §9e. **This facet exists because facet 4 read `W` while the very thing it certifies was invisible on screen** — an authority facet and a legibility facet are two questions, exactly as 5 and 6 are | n/a — the fold is a build fact, not a lane |

NOT SYNCED: health-bar/ping/voice-icon values are computed locally from their own sources; distance fade/occlusion are viewer-local.

Facet 4's authority is the interesting one: uniqueness CANNOT be `CO` (co-authored), because two peers
each choosing "Pelmentor" are both individually correct and neither can see the other. It is the first
facet in this document whose `HA` (host-arbitrated) verdict comes from an impossibility rather than a
preference. Facet 5 is the counter-shape: a pure render property with NO authority axis at all, which
is why "the name renders wrong" was mis-filed as a sync bug for months.

### Skins — `coop/player/skin_registry`, `skin_effects`, `client_model`, `local_body`

NOT SYNCED: pak asset BYTES (each machine must have the pak; missing → local view degrades to kel).

### Player-inventory — `coop/items/player_inventory_sync`, `inventory_wire`, `inventory_pickup_sync`
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | client **projection** (`inventoryData`) → host persistence | W | ST | **PP** | `ClientStreamTick` (+[dev] `inventory_selftest`) | host-terminal, never relayed |
| 1b | client **live carried items** (`GObjStack[0]`) → host persistence | **N** | code | — | not built — the lane does not read the live store | — |

| 3 | inventory-collect blip (2D cue) | U | code | PP | `inventory_pickup_sync::OnReliable` | none (edge) |
| 4 | live-store READ + gap observability (`GObjStack[0]` vs projection, by content) | W | ST | — | `ue_wrap::inventory::ReadLivePersonalStore`, `coop/dev/live_store_readout` (ini-gated, read-only) | n/a (dev instrument) |

NOT SYNCED: the personal inventory is **peer-private by design** — never merged or relayed to other peers; only streamed to host for per-`<guid>.json` persistence.

**FACET 1 IS NARROWER THAN ITS OLD NAME (corrected 2026-07-24, measured).** It used to read "client
live inventory → host persistence". The lane reads `saveSlot.inventoryData`, which is a save-side
**projection** written only by `mainGamemode::saveObjects` — and on a CLIENT that never runs, because
`save_block` holds `gamemode.disableSave=true` and `saveSlot_C::save` gates the gather at op03. So a
client's projection stays at its join-time contents for the whole session, and what gets persisted is
join-time state, not what the player picked up. Measured live: client `GObjStack[0] live=4 proj=0`,
host `live=4 proj=4`. Hence the new row 1b — the live half is **not built**, deliberately: what to do
below reading is gated on `votv-per-player-inventory-scope-BRIEF-2026-07-24.md` (Q1-Q4 answered
2026-07-24; the transfer transaction and the lane split are the queued arcs).

Also measured: `inventoryData` has **no gameplay reader anywhere in the cooked game** (census over
3050 packages; the sole reader is the save-slot menu's repair routine). So facet 1 transports a field
the game only ever writes, while the sibling `equipment`/`hold` arrays it carries alongside DO have
live gameplay readers — one lane, two different kinds of field. RE:
`votv-player-inventory-two-layer-RE-2026-07-24.md` §4.1.

### Sleep — `coop/player/sleep_sync`

NOT SYNCED: per-peer sleepCam view; individual dream CONTENT (only the roll authority is gated).

### Player-damage / hazards — `coop/player/player_damage`, `local_streams`, `dev/restore_vitals`, `coop/player/ko_respawn`
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Install line log-proven both peers; **the cancel itself has not fired on a real hit yet** | none (stateless) |
| 6 | death → KO respawn (default lifecycle) | U | code | per-machine | `coop/player/ko_respawn` (adopted Tarangok, `e230d8df` + audit fold): lethal-hit interceptor + net_pump dead=true backstop → faint ragdoll → respawn at КПП, full vitals; `[death] ko_respawn=1` default. **Smoke-booted only — no death has been exercised through it** | KO is transient (≤ ragdoll_seconds); joiner sees pose/ragdoll stream |

NOT SYNCED: local hazard EFFECTS (screen shake, coffeePower); "stamina" is `sleep` (local-only). The
2026-05-30 permadeath flow survives only as `ko_respawn=0` (COOP_SCOPE death-lifecycle supersede).

### Puppet (unpossessed-orphan drive) — `coop/player/puppet_drive`, `puppet_carry_drive`

NOT SYNCED: puppet CMC integration (parked; owned by our drive); sit/stand posture (OPEN backlog).

### World-events — `coop/world/event_fire_sync`, `event_cue_sync`, `event_active_sync`
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| 3 | cosmetic emitter cue (starRain) | U | code | HA | `event_cue_sync::Tick` | seed (already-broadcast cues) |

NOT SYNCED: `special`/`ariralPrank` RNG (replayed None); verdict 0/-1 rows (creature/prank/pyramid/arirShip/agrav — host-local); unmapped `kClassRowMap` classes (logged LOUD, not replayed); sub-second cues (1 Hz poll caveat).

### Chat — `coop/comms/chat_sync`, `chat_feed`, `chat_bubbles`
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | text line | W | HO | **HA** | `chat_sync::AuthorAndBroadcast` (identity = transport slot; `ChatLine`=119) | **SEED** (`chat_sync::QueueConnectBroadcastForSlot`) — **CA→HA as of 2026-07-29**: chat is host-AUTHORED, not host-relayed, because the relay fires on the NET thread before any game-thread order exists (`session.cpp:459-481`). `ChatMessage`=48 is now a client→host INTENT and left the relay whitelist (RULE 2) |
| 2 | nickname prefix / color | W | HO | HA | `ChatSpeaker`=120 carries nick + custom colour; receiver resolves the palette at apply | **FROZEN at birth** (USER 2026-07-29 "old chat history is essentially a frozen history") — the nick travels WITH the row rather than being looked up, because a lookup answers who is in that slot NOW and slots recycle. `chat_feed::Line::slot` is DELETED (RULE 2) |
| 3 | overhead speech bubble | W | HO | PP | `chat_bubbles::OnChatLine` | none (expires in place) |

NOT SYNCED: nothing outstanding on the WIRE. **OPEN (not a sync gap -- correctness): the 12 implementation defects in design SS19, plus the USER REFRAME of 2026-07-29 (SS20) making the host's record own EVERY history line including the event-feed lines -- which moves the wire to proto 134 and DISSOLVES two of the 12.** (Was: "chat history/scrollback; own line never received back" — both resolved 2026-07-29. A client's own line IS now received back, as the host's authored row; there is no optimistic local echo, so it costs one round trip. PgUp/PgDn scrollback is local-only and needs no wire.)

### Peer-action feed — `coop/comms/peer_action_feed`
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | action line ("&lt;nick&gt; did X") | W | HO | ∅ | `peer_action_feed::Announce` (derived; driving lane owns authority) | none (each driving lane owns its join) |
| 2 | enable toggle (local pref) | U | code | PP | `SetEnabled` | none |

NOT SYNCED: the feed carries no packet (formatting layer); subject is ALWAYS a nickname, never "You".

### Voice — `coop/voice/voice_chat`
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Opus audio frames (3D positional) | W | HO | PO | `voice_chat::Tick` (own mic, host-relayed) | none (realtime, jitter-buffered) |
| 2 | mute / voice-disabled state | U | code | PO | `OnVoiceState` | replay (`ReplayPeerStatesToSlot`) |
| 3 | spatial listener/speaker position | W | HO | ∅ | `voice_chat::Tick` (derived from pose stream) | none (derived) |

NOT SYNCED: device config (mic/output/gain/PTT, local ini); talking indicator (derived locally).

### Save-transfer / join snapshot — `coop/save/save_transfer`, `session/subsystems`
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | request world save | W | HO | CA→HA | `ClientNoteConnected` / `OnRequest` | THIS is the join mechanism |
| 2 | blob announce | W | HO | HA | `save_transfer::OnBegin` | net-thread co-located |
| 3 | blob chunks (CRC, paced) | W | HO | HA | `BulkSink_` | live-capture at request |
| 4 | identity sidecar (index→eid) | U | code | HA | `DeserializeSidecar` (dev-gated) | in the CRC'd stream |
| 5 | snapshot bracket (spawn burst) | W | HO | HA | `ConnectReplayForSlot` | THIS is the join snapshot |
| 6 | blob-vs-live divergence deletes | U | code | HA | `SendBlobDivergenceDeletes` | seed (removes before adds) |
| 7 | in-window save-pos corrections | W | log | HA | `FlushDivergedSavePositionsForSlot_` (F1 probe) | seed / late-arm |
| 8 | meadow-DB join seed | W | ST | HA | `CaptureJoinSnapshot` (+meadow selftest) | seed |

NOT SYNCED: host's canonical slot never sent (scratch only); `gameMode` hard-coded 0 (story only); no `reserve()` cap on the receive buffer (by design).

### Teleport-client — `coop/session/teleport_client`
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | teleport all clients to host | U | code | HA | `TeleportClientsToHost` (slot0 + NaN + AABB 1e6) | n/a (action) |
| 2 | teleport one slot to host | W | HO | HA | `TeleportSlotToHost` | n/a (operator action) |

**CORRECTED 2026-08-29 (`204b068b`): row 2 is NO LONGER the join placement.** It said
"seed = JOIN placement", and that was the v34 behaviour: `subsystems.cpp` teleported a joiner
ONTO THE HOST at ClientWorldReady. That collided with the USER RULE of 2026-08-29 -- every
client appearance spawns at the KPP start point (`net_pump.cpp:687`) -- and SILENTLY WON,
because ClientWorldReady arrives after the client has loaded its world and already placed
itself. Measured on a real join: KPP applied at 17:47:03 to (-37695,69978,6420), overwritten
at 17:47:16 with the host's own (-11,-1047,6186). The v34 placement is retired whole (RULE 2);
`TeleportSlotToHost` now has ONE caller, `moderation.cpp:146` (the F1 admin "bring player to
host"), which is a deliberate operator action and has no mid-join seed. The joiner's placement
facet belongs to net_pump's KPP spawn, not here.

NOT SYNCED: no client→host teleport request path (host-only trigger).

### Session / join-handshake / roster — `coop/session/player_handshake*`, `coop/player/roster`, `players_registry`
The foundational join system: slot assignment, identity announce, cross-peer relay, the world-ready barrier, the b122 version gate.
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | peer slot assignment | U | code | HA | `player_handshake::HandleAssignPeerSlot` (host picks lowest free 1..3) | seed (once per connection) |
| 2 | own Join announce (eid+nick+guid+skin+prefs+color) | W | HO | PO | `player_handshake::HandleJoinMessage` (each peer authors own identity) | replay (latch cleared on disconnect) |
| 3 | cross-peer identity relay | W | HO | ARB | `player_handshake::BroadcastPlayerJoinedFromHost` (host relays validated) | seed (host tells joiner every mirrored client) |
| 4 | client world-ready barrier | W | log | CA | `event_feed` `ClientWorldReady` (`[PILE-1C] slot N world-ready`) | THIS is the load-quiescence barrier |
| 5 | version gate (b122 Paper pair) | W | log | ARB | `player_handshake_version::ValidateJoinVersionOrRefuse` (equality, 3-layer drills) | refused joiner = connected-never-Joined |
| 6 | roster / scoreboard snapshot | V | photo+drill | PP | `roster::Refresh` reads the LEDGER only — **zero role branching** (v131). Presence, identity AND the connection facts are host-published | `RosterRow` (reliable, repair pulse) — the pre-v131 "each board renders what it truthfully knows" was exactly the defect: one column answered transport on some rows and MY ROUTE on others |
| 7 | local Player Element identity | U | code | PO | `players_registry::EnsurePlayerElement_` (own eid in exclusive band) | seed (band set before alloc) |
| 8 | joined-the-game feed line | U | code | ∅ | `player_handshake::AnnounceJoinerOnce` | replay (re-announces on reconnect) |

NOT SYNCED: connection-type/link label + per-peer RTT (each peer's local GNS read); the master-server version-check line (informational only); the whole `session_manager` HTTP lobby layer (Host/Join/Refresh → master, not peer wire); host lobby-listing bookkeeping.

### Moderation — `coop/moderation/` — **NO ReliableKind (acts via GNS close + host-local files)**
Kick/ban/seen-players is a HOST-LOCAL control surface — no state is streamed to clients; a client only ever observes the GNS connection close.
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | kick slot | U | code | HA | `moderation::KickSlot` (GNS close, host-gated) | n/a (live action) |
| 2 | ban slot (online) | U | code | HA | `moderation::BanSlot` (IP+nick → `ban_list::Add` → Kick) | n/a |
| 3 | ban offline (by GUID) | U | code | HA | `moderation::BanOffline` (`seen_players::FindByGuid`) | n/a |
| 4 | ban enforcement (accept filter) | U | code | HA | `session_runtime::BanAcceptFilter` (fail-closed; **LanDirect only**) | rejected pre-slot, pre-handshake |
| 5 | ban-list persistence | U | code | HA | `ban_list::Add`/`WriteFileLocked` (host-local file) | loaded at session start |
| 6 | seen-players registry | U | code | HA | `seen_players::TouchOnJoin` (host-local file) | touch per join |
| 7 | teleport slot to host | U | code | HA | `moderation::TeleportSlotToMe` (delegates teleport) | n/a |

NOT SYNCED: the ENTIRE surface is host-local (no kick/ban/seen state streamed); P2P IP-ban deliberately absent (identity-ban is unbuilt Stage 6); no name/profanity moderation (only a char filter).

### Save-suppression — `coop/save/save_block`, `save_button_disable`, `save_guard`, `save_indicator_suppress` — **NO wire (local lockout)**
Coordination-by-construction: each client blocks its OWN world-save; the host is authoritative purely by being the only peer NOT running the block. No "host saves, others suppress" packet exists.
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | client disk-write block | U | code | HA | `save_block::SaveGameToSlotDetour` (blocks `saveSlot_C`, passes settings) | none (always active once installed) |
| 2 | client native save-cycle gate | U | code | HA | `save_block::Tick` (masked-bit `disableSave=true`) | none |
| 3 | client Save-button grey-out | W | ST | PP | `save_button_disable::ApplyGreyOut` (+[dev] savebtn selftest) | none (self-heal) |
| 4 | pre-session save backup | U | code | HA | `save_guard::BackupSaveOnSessionStart` (host-local, keeps 3) | n/a (before coop state) |
| 5 | SAVED-indicator detect (join window) | U | log | HA | `save_indicator_suppress::OnSaveAnim` (`[SAVED-DETECT]`; detect-only, misnamed) | window around each joiner's capture |

NOT SYNCED: nothing is streamed — all five are per-process local hooks/files; `save_indicator_suppress` performs NO suppression (read-only detector, still "PHASE 1 detect-log").

### Spawn-authority — `coop/world/spawn_authority` — **NO wire (client suppress/park)**
Not a sync system: a client-only layer that cancels/parks VOTV's ambient RNG spawners so the host is the sole roller of shared-world randomness; the products are mirrored by the NPC/roach/wisp lanes.
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | client spawner suppress + tick-park | U | code | HA | `spawn_authority::ParkWalk` / `g_cancelTargets` (RestoreAll repays on session end) | initial park on first client tick (join window) |

NOT SYNCED: everything — transfers no wire state; enforces "host rolls, client stops" locally. Player-anchored spawns (pinecone) are deliberately NOT parked (owner-effect, each peer rolls its own, made visible by `host_spawn_watcher`).

### Pause-guard — `coop/session/pause_guard` — **NO wire (local un-pause)**
Not a sync system: a client-local guard that un-pauses the game in a session (a real MP pause is impossible — one peer's ESC menu must not freeze the shared world). No packet; each peer keeps its own world running.
| # | facet | V | E | Auth | cite | mid-join |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | un-pause enforcement (no true MP pause) | U | code | ∅ | `pause_guard::Tick` (once-per-episode log; un-pause verb races the menu) | none |

NOT SYNCED: everything — local only; the ESC menu still opens for the local player, the world simply does not freeze.

**The one boundary that must not be lost: the FORM is converged; the CELL VALUES are not all
verified.** There are **19 facet rows** across FOUR profiles (8 container + 5 weather + 1 lamp + 5
meadow; the doc's "table rows" figure is higher — it counts the remainder/lane rows too). After the
LABOR pass, their evidence stands:

- **2 hands-on** — container #1, #2: the cited runbook, a human played it.
- **3 real-log** — container #6, weather #1, weather #5: each cites a real matching log line.
- **2 selftest** — meadow #1, #2: an autonomous e2e digest (0->1->0 cross-peer) passed; below `log`,
  above `code` (the new evidence value the meadow profile earned — §7).
- **11 code-read** — the owning code was read and the label matches: container #3
  (`HostAcceptsClientWrite`, arbiter), #4 (the `freshBirth` guard, `prop_drop_intent.cpp:278`), #5
  (`BOUNDARY 2`), #7 (`IsWorldContainerInventory`, fail-closed), weather #2/#3
  (`ReliableKind::RedSky` / `LightningStrike` send+receive), #4 (`weather_fog.cpp` exists), lamp #1
  (verified by ABSENCE — zero `AlampPost` refs in our tree, exactly the "we sync zero facets" claim),
  meadow #3/#4/#5 (order/join-seed/concurrent-merge — the whole lane was read this pass).
- **1 unlooked** — container #8 (`putObjectIn_overlap`): `evidence=none` is honest; no owning code found.

So **only container #8 has no evidence beside it**; the other 18 are code-read, selftest, real-log, or
hands-on. TWO caveats stand: (1) code-verifying a label confirms it *matches the code* — for a
`UNKNOWN/code` row that means "the lane exists, behaviour unobserved", NOT that it behaves; the VERDICT
axis still needs a run. (2) The two ORIGINAL verified cells (container #6, weather #5) were both
*wrong-label catches*; the LABOR pass found no wrong label, only a citation line-rot (currVol, fixed to
a symbol anchor). Read a filled profile as "the form holds and these labels now match the code they
cite", NEVER as "the behaviour is proven".

**Beyond these four DETAILED worked examples, §1–§2 hold the FULL CATALOG** — a 2026-07-23 sweep of the
whole `coop/` tree (8 fact-gatherers + a gap-fill pass), ~67 systems and ~215 facets at a compact tier. That
catalog is looser: its `HO` means "observed in hands-on play" (weaker than the README's auditable
`verified_takes.tsv` "2"), and the large majority of mechanic facets sit at `U/code` — a lane exists,
never observed. The §1 master table is the scannable overview; the four profiles here remain the place
where each label's rationale is spelled out.

## 3. The rules this document is built on (measured 2026-07-22/23, do not re-litigate)

**The row set is JUDGMENT, and it cannot be otherwise.** There is no machine enumerator of facets:

| facet source | machine-enumerable? | why |
|---|---|---|
| verbs | partly | `RegisterVirtualVerb` is a real registration, but verbs COLLAPSE — in `container_contents_sync.cpp` both `addObject` and `takeObj` register with the single id `kVerbDirty` onto the one callback `OnVerbEntry`, which carries no arguments — and a large share of our sync mirrors FIELDS with no verb shape at all |
| field invariants | only where a codec exists | the codec names the fields it packs; a field nobody packs is invisible |
| **races** | **no, in principle** | a race is a property of INTERLEAVINGS, not of source text. `CONFLICT=0` was found by RUNNING; nothing in the tree enumerates the concurrent orderings that have never been tried |

**And a system's facets cross files**, so no file-keyed enumerator would find them even if facets were
enumerable: the `freshBirth` guard in `prop_drop_intent.cpp` (`if (!parked && !freshBirth) continue;`)
drops the item a client extracted from a container — a CONTAINER facet living in a drop-intent file.

**Three consequences, each load-bearing:**

1. **Every system carries a mandatory `remainder` row — with TWO fields, never one.** A facet nobody
   thought of is ABSENT, and an absent row reads as "nothing wrong there" exactly the way a green
   does — the same error asymmetry that killed the syntactic marker filter
   (`[[lesson-syntactic-marker-set-cannot-express-semantic-relevance]]`). The naive remainder
   ("N facets found by RUNNING") has that asymmetry inside IT: a remainder of 0 means either "we ran
   interleavings and found nothing more" or "nobody ever ran one", and reading the second as the
   first is the filter's exact false-negative. So the remainder carries **(a) how many facets were
   found by RUNNING, AND (b) whether this system was EVER exercised under concurrency / a live probe
   at all.** A `0-found / never-run` remainder is `UNKNOWN completeness`, NOT `complete` — the
   incompleteness signal is only meaningful once (b) is yes.
2. **Citations anchor to a SYMBOL or a SECTION, never a bare line** — and a checker that only asks
   "does the citation resolve?" catches a DELETED line while missing a REWRITTEN one, silently
   preserving a VERIFIED over changed semantics
   (`[[lesson-cite-sections-not-lines-in-files-you-also-edit]]`). A row whose cited region changed
   goes **STALE**, not green: it fails into unknown, never into pass.
   **And the anchor is a (file, symbol) PAIR, never a bare symbol** — measured while self-checking
   this very document: `OnVerbEntry` resolves first into `kerfur_form_assembler.h` and `freshBirth`
   into `drive_sync.h`, neither of which is the cited lane. A bare-symbol checker would have reported
   both rows green against the wrong file, which is the same shape as every instrument bug the
   readiness pass hit: the error sits in what the tool considers its own input, so the tool agrees
   with itself.
3. **No percentage at this granule.** Counts are honest (this system has N facets, K verified);
   a percentage is not, because the denominator is the unenumerable set. The README's percentages
   stay where they have a denominator — the class register.

**TWO axes, never one column.** The first draft of this document used a single status and it broke on
its own first instance: facet #4 was `RED` on an INFERENCE while facet #6 sat in `OPEN` on the only
actually MEASURED divergence in the system. A single column was encoding verdict and evidence at once
and ranking them against each other (`[[lesson-split-fused-options-before-comparing-architectures]]`).

| axis | values |
|---|---|
| **VERDICT** — what is true of the behaviour | `WORKS` · `BROKEN` · `NOT BUILT` · `UNKNOWN` |
| **EVIDENCE** — how we know, independent of the verdict | `hands-on` (artifact path, a human played it) · `log` (a matching real log) · `selftest` (an autonomous e2e / digest run passed — below `log`, above `code`; earns neither hands-on nor log per the rule) · `code` (read from source) · `inference` (reasoned, `[RD]`) · `none` |

A verdict is only as good as the evidence beside it, and the pairing is the point: `BROKEN/inference`
and `BROKEN/hands-on` are not the same claim, and `UNKNOWN/log` (we ran it and the path never
executed) is not the same as `UNKNOWN/none` (nobody looked). **No autonomous smoke, e2e selftest or
harness run ever earns `hands-on`** — that is the rule `tools/verified_takes.tsv` already enforces. A
passed autonomous run is not thrown away, though: it lands on the `selftest` value (added §7, the
meadow profile) — strictly more than reading source, strictly less than a real log, and never
`WORKS/hands-on`.

**A third per-facet axis: AUTHORITY — who owns the write.** Surfaced round 8 by the same
falsification the other axes earned: container facets #1 (host→client mirror) and #2 (client→host
extraction) are IDENTICAL on verdict, evidence and sync-lane (`WORKS/hands-on/present`) yet are not
the same facet — #1 is host-authored and the client mirrors, #2 is client-authored and the host
validates. Nothing in verdict/evidence/lane distinguishes them; only WHO authored the write does. And
authority is the central architectural property of the whole project (`docs/COOP_SYNCER_MODEL.md`: the
host runs the arbiter today, a per-element syncer later), so a profile that cannot sort facets by it
cannot answer "which facets does a dedicated-server migration touch?"

| axis | values |
|---|---|
| **AUTHORITY** — who owns the write | `host-authored` (client mirrors) · `client-authored` (host validates) · `arbiter` (host CAS over contested writes) · `co-authored` (either peer authors via the wire, a CRDT merge converges, no owner and no arbiter) · `peer-owned` (each peer authors its OWN disjoint slice — its body, its entity, its mic — streamed to all, no contention and no arbiter) · `peer-private` (never shared) · `none` (convergent local, no owner) |

`none` does NOT mean "independent / safe": a convergent-local facet is only correct while its INPUT is
identical on both peers. That input can be a deterministic shared value (the lamp post's day/night
clock — identical by construction) OR a wire-synced facet from THIS same table (container #6 derives
its volume from the host-authored content #1). So a `none` facet INHERITS a dependency on the facet it
derives from — readable as a relationship between two rows, not a split of the `none` value (round 10
checked: two `none` facets, lamp #1 `WORKS/code` and container #6 `BROKEN/log`, differ on verdict and
evidence, so the falsification test yields no sub-axis). Read `none` + its input row together.

---

## 4. Container (`Aprop_container_C` — 60 classes in the subtree)

Lane: `container_contents_sync.cpp` (853 LOC). Contents live in ONE global `saveSlot.GObjStack`,
addressed by `propInventory.index` (`[[lesson-container-contents-live-in-one-global-gobjstack]]`).

| # | facet | verdict | evidence | authority | citation (symbol / section) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | host -> client contents mirror (`addObject` receive) | **WORKS** | `hands-on` | `host-authored` | `research/handson_runbook_2026-07-22_container_v125.md` — the user saw the burgers |
| 2 | client -> host extraction, upward (`takeObj`) | **WORKS** | `hands-on` | `client-authored` | same runbook — shipped 2/1/0 matched applied 2/1/0 on both peer logs |
| 3 | simultaneous grab by two peers (the CAS) | **UNKNOWN** | `log` | `arbiter` | `HostAcceptsClientWrite()` in `container_contents_sync.cpp`. `CONFLICT=0` on BOTH peers in the 07-22 take: the arbitration never executed once. Unexercised, not proven and not broken |
| 4 | the extracted item reaching the host's world | **BROKEN** | `inference` | `client-authored` | the `freshBirth` guard in `prop_drop_intent.cpp` (`if (!parked && !freshBirth) continue;`). `[RD]` not `[V]`: the log cannot separate "dropped at the guard" from "never enqueued" — both are silence. **v126 (2026-08): FIX SHIPPED, UNVERIFIED** — a container-extract birth is now admitted: `container_contents_sync` arms a takeObj-in-flight latch at the vm_dispatch `takeObj` edge, `prop_drop_intent::OnClientFinishSpawn` consumes it to mark the entry `containerExtract`, and the drain admits it (the client's extracted item's actor is authored host-side via the SAME PropDropIntent path, dup-guarded). The takeObj ProcessEvent POST observer (`prop_container_extract.cpp`) is INERT (measured 0 hits — takeObj is EX_LocalVirtualFunction), so it is not the vehicle. Verdict stays BROKEN until a hands-on take |
| 5 | nested container-in-container | **NOT BUILT** | `code` | `arbiter` (intended) | the `BOUNDARY 2` comment block in `container_contents_sync.cpp` — a nested container's `ints[0][0]` is a sender-side slot index, meaningless on the receiver. Receiver-side bounds needed first |
| 6 | volume/mass re-derivation on extraction | **BROKEN** | `log` | `none` | **NOT host-authored** — `container_contents_sync.cpp` `ResolveRederiveFns` (the "we never raw-write currVol / Mass" comment, ~:430) states each peer RE-DERIVES the volume LOCALLY from the already-synced content via the engine verb `updateVolumesAndMass`. Convergent-local like the lamp post, no owner. The BROKEN root is that the local re-derive did not RUN (the verb resolved null off the instance class — `FindFunction` doesn't walk the superclass chain, `reflection.cpp:427`), NOT that a host stream was missing. A declaring-class fix exists (`411743af`) — **CONFIRMED IN CODE 2026-08** (`ResolveRederiveFns` resolves from `prop_container_C`, the declaring class). **v126 (2026-08): residual author-side gap FIX SHIPPED, UNVERIFIED** — the author of a slice never re-derived its OWN currVol (the host excludes the author from the relay, and native `getObject`/`takeObj(FALSE)` don't call `updateVolumesAndMass`); `BroadcastContainer` now re-derives locally after a change ships. Verdict stays BROKEN until a hands-on take re-checks the stale-`currVol` symptom |
| 7 | slot 0 — the player's personal container | **NOT BUILT** | `code` | `peer-private` | `IsWorldContainerInventory`, fail-closed today. A privacy/product fork and a BOUNDARY 1 redesign; gate:user |
| 8 | the INSERT direction (`putObjectIn_overlap`) | **UNKNOWN** | `none` | `client-authored` (intended) | nobody has looked; no claim either way |
| — | **remainder — the list is open** | **UNKNOWN** | — | — | (a) **3 of 8 facets (#3, #4, #6) were found by RUNNING**, not by reading source — so the majority of what is wrong here was invisible to code reading. (b) **Concurrency WAS exercised** (the 07-22 take produced `CONFLICT=0`), so this system's incompleteness signal is meaningful — but the ONE interleaving that ran did not trigger the CAS, so even here (b) is "run once, not run adversarially" |

**Count, not percentage:** 8 facets — 2 `WORKS`, 2 `BROKEN`, 2 `NOT BUILT`, 2 `UNKNOWN`; by evidence,
2 `hands-on`, 2 `log`, 2 `code`, 1 `inference`, 1 `none`.

**Two rows earn the split axis immediately.** #6 is the system's highest-confidence bad news —
`BROKEN` on a measured cross-peer divergence — and the single-status draft had it filed under `OPEN`,
below an inferred one. #3 is the opposite shape: `UNKNOWN/log` means we ran it and the code path
never executed, so every code-derived view of this system reads the lane GREEN while the arbitration
it exists to perform has never once run. Neither row is expressible in a class, verb or lane profile.

**A SECOND container lane exists and is NOT in this table** (found by the 2026-07-23 completeness
re-audit): the container's OPEN/CLOSED device state rides `ReliableKind::ContainerState` through the
`interactable_sync` device-state family (alongside Door/Light/Garage/Appliance), entirely separate from
the contents CRDT profiled here — profiled as its own row in §2's device-state table. The container
object thus spans TWO systems (contents + openable-device); this §4 covers only contents. That a
converged 8-facet worked example still had a whole sibling lane outside its frame is the §3 lesson in
miniature: the facet set is not machine-enumerable, and "converged" never means "complete".

---

## 5. Weather — the FORM-AGAINST-A-VERB-LESS-SYSTEM control

Chosen as the second control precisely because it is the OPPOSITE shape from the container: almost no
verb interception, sync is field-state + reliable messages, and the system spans **five files**
(`weather_sync.cpp` orchestrator + `weather_rain` / `weather_fog` / `weather_lightning` /
`weather_redsky`). If the split axis fills here, the form is not container-shaped; if a verb-less
system would not fill at all, the form names its own limit. It filled — and the EVIDENCE axis
immediately did work: it separated a MAP `[V]` from a player `hands-on`, which a single status column
would have flattened to one green.

| # | facet | verdict | evidence | authority | citation (symbol / section) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | rain / snow scalar mirror | **WORKS** | `log` | `host-authored` | client apply line `weather: applied flags 0x1D -> 0x1C ... rain-tx=1 scalars-changed=1` in `docs/piles/test-evidence/handson-s31-doom-CLIENT.log`. This is a REAL matching log, NOT the map `[V]` — see the correction note below |
| 2 | red sky | **WORKS** (wire leg) | `log` | `host-authored` | **REROOTED 2026-08-29 (`4304e04e`, the arigalit red-mist report):** the organic trigger is daynightCycle newDay's 1% roll via `EX_LocalVirtualFunction` — PE-invisible, so the old POST observers NEVER fired organically (zero broadcast lines in every log on disk; this row's old "lane exists / UNKNOWN" was measuring an INERT lane). Now: host FIELD POLL (`HostPollEdge`, gm.redSky+isred) + client birth-catch (`weather_event_births`, uncommanded `redSkyEvent_C` births destroyed at FinishSpawn) + per-joiner ON seed. Evidence = matching 2-peer logs 2026-08-29 01:37: host `field-poll edge` state=1/0 → client `red-sky Apply set(true)` / `set(false)+destroyed`, same-second, both directions. NOT hands-on (nobody looked at both screens); the ORGANIC-roll suppression leg is `code`-tier (the birth-catch installed both peers; a real 1% roll has not been observed since) |
| 3 | lightning strike | **UNKNOWN** | `code` | `host-authored` | `ReliableKind::LightningStrike` in `weather_lightning.cpp` — lane exists, host broadcasts strike loc. NO client receive line in the logs (grepped). Same map-`[V]`-inadmissible note |
| 4 | fog (host-authoritative) | **UNKNOWN** | `code` | `host-authored` | `weather_fog.cpp` — host-clear heartbeat (MTA `CBlendedWeather::DoPulse` precedent), client backstop destroys stray rolling-fog. Built s25, **smoke only** — and per §3 a smoke earns neither `hands-on` NOR `log`; the lane exists, its behaviour is unobserved |
| 5 | wind | **BROKEN** | `log` | `host-authored` | `changeWindOrigin` PRE-interceptor client-suppresses the gust roll, host streams `windTarget`; `COOP_SYNC_MAP.md` records "wind desync under live probe — INSTRUMENTED, not diagnosed". The verdict is BROKEN from the live probe; the ROOT is undiagnosed |
| — | **remainder — the list is open** | **UNKNOWN** | — | — | (a) **0 facets found by RUNNING** — but (b) **weather was NEVER exercised under concurrency**; the wind bug came from a live SINGLE-flow probe, not an interleaving. So this 0 is `UNKNOWN completeness`, NOT "nothing missed" — reading it as complete would be the marker-filter's false-negative. weather's RNG knob jitter (`COOP_RNG_AUTHORITY.md:157`) is a MECHANIC input neutralized by the host stream, deliberately not a row |

**Count (updated 2026-08-29):** 5 facets — **2 `WORKS`, 1 `BROKEN`, 2 `UNKNOWN`**; by evidence,
**0 `hands-on`, 3 `log`, 2 `code`**. (Red sky flipped UNKNOWN→WORKS on real matching 2-peer logs after
the reroot; fog's CLIENT-suppression premise was corrected the same night — its PRE interceptor never
saw the organic EX_Local caller, the 3 s reconcile was the real cleanup, and the new birth-catch now
kills a client fog roll at spawn.)

**THE CORRECTION IS THE FINDING (round 4).** The first draft of this table read "4 `WORKS`, 1
`BROKEN`" — I had assigned `WORKS/log` to facets 1-4 from `COOP_SYNC_MAP.md`'s `[V]` markers, which
are MAP verdicts, exactly the doc-status source the readiness pass measured as unreliable in both
directions. Applying the EVIDENCE axis STRICTLY — demand a real matching log line, not a map marker —
collapsed THREE false greens: only facet 1 has an actual client apply line; redsky/lightning/fog have
a lane in code and no observed behaviour. This is the two-axis form doing precisely the job it exists
for, on its author: **a map `[V]` is `code`-tier at best, never `log`, and never `WORKS` on its own.**
The spine being the SYSTEM (not the file) is re-confirmed: no file-keyed row could name "wind" as one
facet, since its logic is split across the interceptor and the orchestrator's stream.

**Meadow probe (Q4) — now PROMOTED to the full profile in §7.** The probe established that "facet"
resolves for a 0-class save-CRDT (the "0 classes" was the CXX-dump CLASS count; the system lives as a
save-struct CRDT and its facets are OPERATIONS — append / delete / order — not classes). §7 completes
it into a five-facet profile and, in doing so, earned the `selftest` and `co-authored` values. That a
0-class system yields facets confirms rows = facets, spine = system — a behaviour needs no class to
exist.

## 6. Lamp posts — the WE-SYNC-ZERO control (the other half of the ask)

The user asked for "что синхроним И что НЕ синхроним". The first two controls are systems we DO sync.
This third is the untested half: a VOTV system we sync **zero** facets of, chosen because a
fully-unsynced system exercises two things neither prior control did — (a) does the form MOVE on a
third, different-shaped control (round-5 Q1: convergence is a control that changes nothing), and
(b) can the form even EXPRESS "we sync nothing here, and that is correct"?

`AlampPost_C` — outdoor lamp posts, `NOT synced` per `COOP_SCOPE.md` (§ Out of scope): the game's
day/night cycle (`mainGamemode` tracks `allLampPosts`) runs identically on both peers, so lamps
toggle in lockstep with no wire traffic. RE-confirmed in the Phase 5D doors+lights pass 2026-05-25.

| # | facet | verdict | evidence | authority | citation (symbol / section) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | day/night lamp toggle | **WORKS** | `code` | `none` | `AlampPost_C` driven by `mainGamemode`'s `allLampPosts` day/night cycle; RE pass 2026-05-25. Convergent local computation on both peers — correct WITHOUT a wire lane. Authority `none`: no peer owns the write, both compute it |
| — | **sync lane** | **NONE — and correct** | — | — | zero facets carry a wire lane, BY DESIGN, not by omission. The reason is convergent local compute, not a deferred gap — see the form note below |
| — | **remainder — the list is open** | **UNKNOWN** | — | — | (a) 0 facets found by running; (b) never exercised under concurrency. But here the completeness question is narrower: the only risk is that the two local cycles DESYNC (a clock drift), which no run has checked |

**THE FORM MOVED — a third time, and this is the round-6 finding.** The lamp post exposed that the
verdict `NOT BUILT` was fusing two states the way the single status column fused verdict and evidence:

- `NOT BUILT / gap` — we should sync it and have not (container facets 5, 7: nested, slot 0).
- `NOT BUILT / needs none` — we will NEVER sync it because it is correct by construction (lamp posts).

A reader seeing `NOT BUILT` on both cannot tell an owed lane from a lane that must never exist.
So the **SYNC-LANE** state is split: `present` / `none-by-design (correct)` / `none-but-owed (gap)`.
This is a genuine form change, not a data fix — which means the running rate is now **3 controls, 3
form changes** (split axis / two-field remainder / sync-lane trichotomy). **The form is NOT
converged**: every control profiled so far has moved it. Convergence is a control that moves nothing,
and I do not yet have one. See §8 — but §7 (meadow) is the closest yet: it moved only VALUES, not
axes, which is the first control to leave the axis set alone.

---

## 7. Meadow — the SAVE-CRDT control (the hardest test of "facet", and the first that moved no axis)

Chosen as the fourth control because it is a fourth distinct SHAPE: not verb-driven like the container,
not field-state like weather, not a convergent-local clock like the lamp — a **save-struct CRDT** with
ZERO game classes of its own. The DB lives entirely in `saveSlot.savedSignals_0`; its facets are
OPERATIONS on that struct, not classes. If the five-axis form survives a system with no class and no
verb-shaped facet, the spine claim (system, not class/verb) holds under its hardest case. It survived —
and it grew the vocabulary by TWO new VALUES with NO new axis, the "converging" signal §8 defines.

Lane: `meadow_db_sync.cpp` (884 LOC). Three reliable kinds — `MeadowAppend` / `MeadowDelete` /
`MeadowOrder`; convergence is a broadcast-acknowledged multiset shadow (`g_shadow`, ContentHash→count)
plus tombstones (`g_tombs`) for the delete-vs-append race.

| # | facet | verdict | evidence | authority | citation (symbol / section) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | append a signal line | **WORKS** | `selftest` | `co-authored` | `AuthorLine` → `ApplyAppendBlob` + `MeadowAppend`. The [dev] `SelftestTick` injects a synthetic row and `LogDigest` asserts 0→1 cross-peer. Either peer authors; the multiset merges with no host validation — see the new-value note |
| 2 | delete a line | **WORKS** | `selftest` | `co-authored` | `ApplyDeleteByHash` / `OnDelete` + `MeadowDelete`; `g_tombs` covers a delete arriving before its append. The selftest's 1→0 remove closes the same e2e |
| 3 | reorder (`sortSignal`) | **UNKNOWN** | `code` | `arbiter` | `ApplyOrderBlob` + `MeadowOrder`, host-canonical LWW (a client order line is dropped unless `senderSlot==0`; the host applies any peer's move and re-broadcasts ITS canonical). **The selftest cannot reach this facet:** `LogDigest`'s sum is `h*count`, order-INDEPENDENT by construction (~:226) — a permutation leaves the digest identical, so the e2e that proves append/delete is BLIND to order. Lane exists, behaviour unobserved |
| 4 | join-seed into a populated DB | **UNKNOWN** | `code` | `host-authored` | `CaptureJoinSnapshot` / `QueueConnectBroadcastForSlot`, `seedDelta = cur − snap − unmaskedPendingNet`. The mid-join answer (principle 8). The selftest injects AFTER both peers connect, so it exercises live-append-cross-peer, never a join INTO a pre-populated store — this lane is code-only |
| 5 | concurrent append/delete merge | **UNKNOWN** | `code` | `co-authored` | the multiset shadow + `g_tombs` in `ApplyAppendBlob`. This is the CRDT's whole reason to exist and — exactly like the container CAS (#3) — has NEVER run: the selftest is a single sequential host inject/remove |
| — | **remainder — the list is open** | **UNKNOWN** | — | — | (a) **2 of 5 facets (append, delete) were exercised by RUNNING** (the autonomous e2e); the other 3 only read. (b) **never exercised under CONCURRENCY** — the selftest is one sequential host flow, so the merge (#5), the order LWW contest (#3), and a real join-seed (#4) are all un-run. A 3-peer RELAY question is also open: a CLIENT append reaches the host (`ApplyAppendBlob` does not re-broadcast), so whether a client's line reaches OTHER clients before a join-seed is unverified |

**Count:** 5 facets — 2 `WORKS`, 3 `UNKNOWN`; by evidence, 2 `selftest`, 3 `code`. All 5 labels are
code-verified this pass (the whole lane was read).

**TWO new VALUES, ZERO new axes — the convergence signal.** Meadow is the first control whose facets
did not fit the existing vocabulary yet needed no new QUESTION asked of a facet:

- **`selftest` (EVIDENCE).** The prior three profiles never needed a value between `code` and `log` —
  their facets were hands-on, real-log, or unobserved. Meadow's append/delete are proven by an
  autonomous e2e digest, which §3's rule earns NEITHER hands-on NOR log, yet is strictly MORE than
  reading source. Under the old vocabulary append (e2e-proven) and order (never run) both read `code`,
  collapsing "an e2e proved it" with "nobody ran it" — the two-collapsed-rows falsification that earns
  the value. Ordering of the tier: `hands-on` > `log` > **`selftest`** > `code`.
- **`co-authored` (AUTHORITY).** Meadow append is authored by EITHER peer, wire-synced, and converges
  via the multiset+tombstone merge with NO host validation or rejection — not `host-authored` (a client
  authors too), not `client-authored` (the host authors too), not `arbiter` (nothing CAS-gates an
  append; contrast the meadow ORDER facet, which IS `arbiter` — host-canonical LWW), not `none` (it has
  a wire lane, unlike the convergent-local lamp). Append (`co-authored`) vs order (`arbiter`) are two
  facets of ONE system that collapse without the value — the falsification that earns it.

Both are new VALUES on existing axes, not new axes. Per §8's gate that is normal taxonomy growth, and
on a system as differently-shaped as a class-less CRDT it is the strongest evidence yet that the FIVE
axes are the right frame: a fourth control moved the vocabulary at its margins without adding a
question. It does not PROVE completeness (the standing gate forbids that) — but it is the first control
to add zero axes, which is precisely the signal §8 was waiting for.

---

## 8. Convergence state — the AXES are settled; VALUES stay open (that is correct)

The first read of the 3/3 rate was "not converged, keep profiling until a control changes nothing."
That test is WRONG, and measurement shows why: a control that changes NOTHING will never exist for a
qualitative taxonomy — the vocabulary meets reality at the margins forever, so demanding it stop is
demanding it stop meeting reality. The right convergence test is narrower:

> **Does a new control add a new VALUE to an existing axis, or a whole new AXIS?**
> New values are normal and expected (a taxonomy grows). A new AXIS means the model was incomplete.

Measured against that test, the changes were each a new **axis**, not a value. The axis set now stands
at FIVE, mapping onto five distinct questions a sync facet raises:

| axis | the question it answers |
|---|---|
| **VERDICT** (WORKS/BROKEN/NOT BUILT/UNKNOWN) | does it work? |
| **EVIDENCE** (hands-on/log/selftest/code/inference/none) | how do we know? |
| **REMAINDER** (found-by-running × ever-run) | is the facet list whole? |
| **SYNC-LANE** (present / none-by-design / none-but-owed) | should it carry a lane at all? |
| **AUTHORITY** (host-authored/client-authored/arbiter/co-authored/peer-owned/peer-private/none) | who owns the write? |

Two of those values — `selftest` (EVIDENCE) and `co-authored` (AUTHORITY) — were added by the FOURTH
control (meadow, §7), each earned by a two-collapsed-rows falsification. A third — `peer-owned`
(AUTHORITY) — came from the full-catalog sweep (§1–§2). All three are new VALUES, not new axes: the axis
SET has stood at five across four worked shapes AND an exhaustive ~67-system sweep.

The completeness check the project requires
(`[[lesson-a-unit-of-measure-must-express-the-known-red-case]]`): every known measured-red this pass
hit maps into the vocabulary with no leftover — `currVol` and wind = `BROKEN/log`; the never-run CAS =
`UNKNOWN/log`; the lost extracted item = `BROKEN/inference`; the correctly-unsynced lamp post =
`WORKS/code` + `lane=none-by-design`.

**Convergence call — deliberately WEAKER than round 7's.** Round 7 declared "four axes, complete, no
fifth question apparent." Round 8's falsification produced a fifth (authority) IMMEDIATELY, using the
project's own two-collapsed-rows method — so the completeness claim has now FAILED ONCE, and asserting
"five is complete" from the same reasoning that just failed at four would be laundering an inference
the evidence contradicts. **So the call is: FIVE axes is the CURRENT model, and its completeness is
NOT claimed.** The falsification test is the standing gate — any future system that produces two facets
identical on all five axes but distinct in kind reveals a sixth. That the axes went 4→5 under one
round's scrutiny is the reason to ship the model as OPEN, not to keep hunting a closure the taxonomy
may not have.

**Update after the LABOR pass (meadow, §7): the first control that added no axis.** The three prior
profiles each ADDED an axis (the 3/3 rate §6 recorded). Meadow — a fourth, deliberately different shape
(a class-less save-CRDT) — added two new VALUES (`selftest`, `co-authored`) and NO axis: every meadow
facet mapped onto one of the five existing questions. Under the correct convergence test (new value vs
new axis) that is the FIRST positive signal for five-axis completeness. It still does not license the
completeness CLAIM — one non-adding control is not proof, and the two-collapsed-rows gate stays open for
a sixth — but the axis set surviving its hardest structural case (no class, no verb) is the strongest
evidence the frame is right.

**Update after the FULL-CATALOG sweep (§1–§2, ~67 systems, ~215 facets): ONE new VALUE, still NO new
axis.** The whole-codebase sweep produced exactly one value the four worked examples never needed —
`peer-owned` on the AUTHORITY axis (each peer authors its OWN disjoint slice — body, entity, mic —
streamed to all, no contention, no arbiter; distinct from `peer-private`=never-shared and
`co-authored`=shared-contested, and it surfaced a real mislabel: streamed body pose had been filed
`peer-private`, which §3 defines as "never shared"). Every one of ~200 facets otherwise mapped onto the
five existing questions with a value already in the vocabulary. So across four deliberately-different
shapes AND an exhaustive sweep, the AXIS count has held at five while the VALUE set grew by three total
(`selftest`, `co-authored`, `peer-owned`) — exactly the "taxonomy grows at its margins, the questions do
not" pattern §8's test predicts for a converged frame. Completeness is STILL not claimed (the gate stays
open), but a full sweep adding no axis is the strongest evidence yet obtainable short of a proof.

**Why this is a ship-able deliverable, not an open loop:** the SETTLED CORE never moved across any
round — spine = the SYSTEM; rows = FACETS, hand-named, set not machine-enumerable; citations =
(file, symbol); no percentage at this granule. The AXES are a growing-but-falsifiable vocabulary with
a named test, not a guess. The user asked to NAME what we sync and don't, per system — four profiles
now do that, each internally complete on all five axes (the authority column was back-filled the same
round it was found, not deferred: a doc declaring five axes while showing four would be the very
"unnamed boundary reads as green" trap this document codifies in §3). The remaining work is LABOR
(more systems) and the class-register verdict/evidence split (named in the README). Neither is
blocked; both are hand-off-able.

**No sixth axis is proposed.** A timing/rate axis was considered and DROPPED: the standing gate
requires a falsification instance (two facets identical on all five axes, distinct only in the
candidate dimension) and none exists for timing. Proposing an axis without it would be the
closure-hunt round 7 named.

## 9. Systems still unprofiled / partial

**The FIRST §1–§2 sweep was NOT exhaustive — a self-audit caught it, and the gaps were then filled.**
A 2026-07-23 self-audit (cross-checking every wire lane and `*_sync.cpp` stem against the doc) found six
real systems the first 8 gatherers missed. **Five have since been profiled** (a second gap-fill pass,
now in §1–§2):

- ✅ **Saved-signals store** (`signal_sync`, `SavedSignal*`) — a SECOND save-CRDT (meadow shape, no order).
- ✅ **World-actor mirror** (`world_actor_sync`/`mirror`) — the generic lane the pyramid rides.
- ✅ **Session / join-handshake / roster** (`player_handshake*`, `roster`, `players_registry`) — the
  foundational join/identity/version-gate/roster system.
- ✅ **Moderation** (`moderation/`) — kick/ban/seen; NO wire (GNS close + host-local files).
- ✅ **Save-suppression** (`save/save_block` etc.) — client save lockout; NO wire (local hooks).
- ⏳ **Kerfur reconcile + prop-adoption** (`kerfur_reconcile`, `kerfur_prop_adoption`) — STILL PARTIAL:
  off→active retire arming + prop-form save-kerfur adoption were referenced but not fully read.

**A finding the gap-fill surfaced:** three of these (moderation, save-suppression, spawn-authority) carry
NO ReliableKind at all — they are coop systems enforced by GNS-close / host-local files / client-local
hooks, "coordination by construction". A wire-lane census (the first instinct) is structurally blind to
them; only a system-by-system read finds them. That is the §3 spine claim (system, not lane) proving out.

**A SECOND completeness re-audit (2026-07-23, when the user asked "точно ВСЁ?") found more** — proof the
answer to "did you profile everything?" is still, honestly, "not provably":
- ✅ **`ContainerState`** — a SECOND container lane (open/closed device state, `interactable_sync` family),
  entirely separate from the contents CRDT §4 profiled. Now a row in §2's device-state table + a §4 note.
- ✅ **`prop_sound`** — the grab/drop native-parity sound; a presentation facet of physics props (now #12).
- ✅ **`pause-guard`** — the local un-pause guard (no true MP pause); a no-wire system (now in §2).

**The DIG result (2026-07-23, third pass, "копай") — WIRE-complete, provably; FACET-complete, never.**
The residual was dug to the bottom, and the honest split is now sharp:

- **Every WIRE-CARRIED lane IS profiled — this is verifiable, not asserted.** There are **113 distinct
  `ReliableKind`s** referenced in the tree; a script confirmed EVERY one has a dispatch-router case, and
  each maps to a system in §1. There are **13 unreliable `MsgType` pose/stream kinds** (ClockPose,
  DeskCursorPose, DeskSimPose, DishPose, EntityPose, HandPose, PoseSnapshot, PropPose, RagdollPose,
  ReelPose, TrashCarryPose, VoiceFrame, WorldActorPose) and all 13 were cross-checked to a specific facet
  (e.g. PropPose → Physics props #4, WorldActorPose → World-actor #3, ReelPose → Tape-caddy #2). **No
  wire lane, reliable or unreliable, is outside the catalog.**
- **The ~100 uncited `coop/*.cpp` files carry no new SYSTEM.** Triaged by whether each does wire/hook
  work: `dev/` probes (~45, tools), `net/`+`dispatch/`+`element/` infra (~28: transport, the four
  routers that list every kind, the identity registry, the `session_*` send-side plumbing), and
  IMPLEMENTATION files of profiled systems (`remote_prop_*`/`prop_lifecycle` → Physics props,
  `voice_playback` → Voice, `npc_sync`/`npc_world_enum` → NPC, `world_load_episode` → the session
  barrier). Each was checked; none is a hidden game system.
- **What CANNOT be proven complete — and §3 says so.** The facet set is not machine-enumerable: a RACE
  is not a wire lane (the container CAS lives only in an interleaving), and non-wire local behaviors
  (`net_stats` HUD, a grab sound, a local guard) have no lane to census. The dig found the main non-wire
  systems (moderation, save-suppression, spawn-authority, pause-guard) and the main presentation facets
  (prop_sound); more presentation trivia may exist, but there is no wire lane and no game system left
  unaccounted. **So the honest ceiling is: wire coverage is complete and checkable; facet coverage is
  bounded below by that and open above — a count with a named residual, never a checkmark.**

**Genuinely infra, not game-facet systems** (correctly excluded): `element/` (identity registry),
`net/` (transport), the `dispatch/` routers, `config/`, `dev/`, `session/net_pump` + `subsystems`
plumbing. These carry no game facet of their own.

**Adding a system:** author its facets by hand with a citation each and a two-field remainder row (§3).
Do NOT seed rows from a grep — a syntactic proxy for "is this synced" errs both ways and only the
false-negative side is measurable. (The self-audit's own `ReliableKind::\b<name>\b` check false-flagged
~100 lanes as MISSING — a broken word-boundary grep, the exact instrument-self-agreement trap §3 names;
the reliable signal was the file-stem cross-check, hand-verified.)
